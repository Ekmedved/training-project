As part of the team at "Streamchik" online store, specializing in global computer game sales, historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. The objective is to uncover patterns that contribute to a game's success. This analysis will enable the identification of potentially popular products and the planning of effective advertising campaigns. Utilizing data up to December 2016, the focus is on developing a methodology for working with data, regardless of whether forecasting sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or projecting for 2027 based on 2026 data. The dataset includes the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) abbreviation, an association determining age ratings for computer games, categorized into groups such as "For adults," "For younger children," or "For teenagers."
