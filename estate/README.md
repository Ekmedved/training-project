This project focuses on researching apartment sale ads utilizing data from the Yandex service. The dataset includes an archive of ads for apartment sales in St. Petersburg and neighboring areas spanning several years. The objective is to develop a method for determining the market value of real estate. By setting parameters, an automated system will be built to detect anomalies and fraudulent activity within the real estate market. The dataset comprises two types of data for each apartment: user-entered information and automatically obtained data based on cartographic data, such as distance to the city center, airport, nearest park, and reservoir.
